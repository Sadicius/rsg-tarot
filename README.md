As I've been around here for a while, I share with you a work I did on tarot cards.

# Note
has 175 cards, 8 possible decks
has a box to store only the cards
html animation and custom css work
cards of each custom deck 
different types of rarity for the cards
store to sell the cards for money to npc snake dancer
different locations for exchanging some cards for the decks to npc snake dancer

# Version oficial thanks
this is a reconverted work from FIVEM, the original script is the one from Pokemon cards but redesigned and adapted to REDM by me.
